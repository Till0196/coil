`coild`
=======

`coild` runs on all nodes to accept requests from `coil` CNI plugin.

Command-line flags for etcd connection are defined in [etcdutil][].

Other command-line options are:

| Option               | Default value    | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `http`               | "127.0.0.1:9383" | REST API endpoint.                       |
| `table-id`           | 119              | Routing table ID to export routes        |
| `protocol-id`        | 30               | Route author ID                          |
| `scan-interval`      | 10m              | Scan interval of unused IP address block |

Etcd Endpoints lookup
---------------------

`coild` looks for [`Endpoints`][Endpoints] resource in `kube-system` namespace
if `-etcd-endpoints` option value begins with `@`.

If the value is `@myetcd`, it looks for `kube-system/myetcd` Endpoints and
connect etcd servers using IP addresses listed in the resource.

Such a Endpoints can be created with YAML like this:
```yaml
kind: Endpoints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myetcd
subsets:
  - addresses:
      - ip: 1.2.3.4
      - ip: 5.6.7.8
    ports:
      - port: 2379
```

Environment variables
---------------------

`coild` requires following environment variable to be set.

* `COIL_NODE_NAME`: The node name where `coild` is running.

As `coild` should run as [`DaemonSet`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/), these environment variables can be given as follows:

```yaml
      containers:
        - name: coild
          image: quay.io/cybozu/coil:0
          command:
            - /coild
          env:
            - name: COIL_NODE_NAME
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: spec.nodeName
```
